<h1 style="font-size:200%; font-family:verdana; color:Black;" align="center">Firstly, we shall talk on the History of HTML</h1>
<p style="font-size:140%;">Hyper Text Makrup Language (HTML) is a text-based approach to describing how content contained within an HTML file is structured. 
This markup tells a web browser how to display text, images and other forms of multimedia on a webpage.</p>
<p style="font-size:140%;" align="justify">The first version of HTML was written by Tim Berners-Lee in 1993. Since then, there have been many different versions of HTML. 
The most widely used version throughout the 2000's was HTML 4.01, which became an official standard in December 1999. Another version, XHTML, was a rewrite 
of HTML as an XML language.</p>
<h1 style="font-size:200%; font-family:verdana;">Tim Berners-Lee</h1>
<p style="font-size:140%;" align="justify">Tim Berners-Lee, a physicist at the CERN research institute in Switzerland invented HTML in 1991. This first version
 consisted of 18 HTML tages. Now, there are currently about 140 HTML tags, although not all of them are supported by modern browsers. Sir Tim Berners-Lee 
 invented the World Wide Web while at CERN, the European Particle Physics Laboratory, in 1989. He wrote the first web client and server in 1990. His 
 specifications of URL, HTTP and HTML were refined as Web technology spread. The Wealth Record has his net worth at $60 million - or more than £45.5 million.
 According to The Richest, his personal wealth is valued at $50 million while Celebrity Net Worth reckon he is worth $10 million. The first website at CERN – 
 and in the world – was dedicated to the World Wide Web project itself and was hosted on Berners-Lee's NeXT computer. In 2013, CERN launched a project to
 restore this first ever website: info.cern.ch. On 30 April 1993, CERN put the World Wide Web software in the public domain. Born: 8 June 1955 (age 68 years), London, United Kingdom</p>

<li><p style="font-size:140%;" align="justify">1995- HTML 2.0 is published. This contains the features of HTML 1.0 plus new features. This remained the standard markup language for designing and creating websites until 1997.</p></li>
<li><p style="font-size:140%;" align="justify">1997- HTML 3.0 was invented. Here, Dave Raggett introduced a fresh draft on HTML, which improved new features of HTML and gave more powerful characteristics for 
webmasters in designing websites. Unfortunately, the powerful features slowed down the browser in applying further improvements.</p></li>
<li><p style="font-size:140%;" align="justify">1999- The widely-used HTML 4.0 comes out. It is very successful.</p></li>
<li><p style="font-size:140%;" align="justify">2014- HTML 5.0 is released and used worldwide. It is said to be the extended version of HTML 4.01 which was published in 2012.</p></li>

<h1 style="font-size:200%; font-family:verdana; color:Black;" align="center">Secondly, we shall talk about CSS</h1>
<p style="font-size:140%;" align="justify">Cascading Style Sheet (CSS) is a computer language for laying out and structuring web pages (HTML or XML).<b>CSS COMES IN THREE TYPES:</b>
In a separate file (external),
at the top of a web page document (internal),
right next to the text it decorates (inline). CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.</p>
<p style="font-size:140%;" align="justify">CSS was first proposed in 1994, by Norwegian technologist Håkon Wium Lie, who was then working at the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) 
with Berners-Lee. Two years later the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) adopted the first standardized specifications for CSS, called CSS1.</p>
<h1 style="font-size:200%; font-family:verdana; color:Black;">Håkon Wium Lie</h1>
<p style="font-size:140%;" align="justify">  He said on an interview, [In April 1999 I joined Opera Software to make sure there's more than one browser on the Web. You can find more informatition about me from my home page]

I work for the guy who invented the Web. His name is Tim. He's now the director of the World Wide Web Consortium which is hosted by MIT and INRIA. I'm based at the INRIA site in southern France, but often telecommute to work. I spend most of my time developing and promoting style sheets. Style sheets describe how documents are presented on screens, in print, or perhaps how they are pronounced. In 1994 I proposed the concept of Cascading Style Sheets which are now, some years later, implemented by major browsers. You can read about it in a book I co-authored. I'm interested in the functional, esthetic and political aspects of the Web -- in particular how Web documents are authored and presented. I'm a graduate of the MIT Media Lab which did not invent the Web. My claim to fame is that I'm mentioned in David Siegel's diary.

Off work, I spend time with my kids. We all like to paint. Other interests include pipe organs. I plan to build one myself, and I'm looking for a pipe organ kit. Among the composers I enjoy the most is Anton Bruckner (try his 9th symphony, 2nd movement!) and Carl Nielsen (try his 5th symphony -- or visit his museum!). Born: 1965 (age 59 years), Halden, Norway</p>
